Jot Digital Ink
===============

The Jot Digital Ink framework, also known as JotUI, is a pre-built UIView library that provides you with a drop in ready to go drawing UIView replacement.

Features:
- JotView class
- Undo
- Redo
- Pressure sensativity
- Velocity
- Jot Family Bluetooth connectivity
- Base classes for Pen, Marker and Eraser

Getting Started
---------------
Built upon the JotTouchSDK, the Jot Digital Ink framework is able to be added to any iOS 6 app. The framework provides a JotView class that extends the UIView class. JotView and it's delegate provide acess to the user's touch points and allows the developer the freedom to provide lines as needed.

The Getting Started guide will walk you through the process of linking the framework to configuring the JotView methods and delegates.

Example Application
-------------------
The repo includes an example project that demonstrates the useage of the framework and a simple configuration of the JotTouchSDK. The project includes demonstration brushes and common behaviors. These are meant to be a good starting point to build upon for additional textures and shapes.
